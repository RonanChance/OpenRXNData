# body = "Hi all, thought I'd post here to reach a wider audience as the skin specialists currently treating me seem no closer to diagnosing this as they haven't come across this before. I've already been seen by approximately 10 different skin specialists at the hospital, 2 private skin specialists and no one seems to be able to diagnose it as it's fairly spontaneous and seems to differ in appearance each time.\n\nI received my first shot of covid vaccine - PFIZER on 3rd July 2021.\n\nI was bitten by something resembling a horsefly twice towards the end of July on separate days. The bites wouldn't heal and got worse, I was prescribed Betamethasone with chinoform which had no effect.\n\nGot second dose of covid vaccine - MODERNA on 21st August 2021.\n\n10 days after second dose, started breaking out in itchy spots all over my body, including my scalp, inside my ears, inside nose, feet, balls, etc. These were leaking a yellow liquid (not puss) - See round 1 pics\n\nHospitalised on 27th October 2021 treated me with:\n\n\\- Daily <span style=\"background-color: var(--supplement_highlight);\">potassium</span> Permanganate baths (15mins)\n\n\\- Betamethasone with chinoform + moisturising cream\n\n\\- Antiobiotics (<span style=\"background-color: var(--medication_highlight);\">dicloxacillin</span>)\n\n\\- Antiviral (<span style=\"background-color: var(--medication_highlight);\">valacyclovir</span>)\n\n\\- Antihistamine (<span style=\"background-color: var(--medication_highlight);\">cetirizine</span>)\n\nSkin was immediately better after 2 days and I was released after 5 days. I was left with dark pigmentation all over body from the spots.\n\nStarted breaking out again towards end of December/early Jan - 2 months after being released from hospital. I was prescribed 30mg prednisolone daily for 2 weeks and then down dosing for 2 weeks. This did not help and the spots kept appearing all over body, including the insides of my hands, feet, etc - See round 2 pics\n\nHospitalised again for the second time on 06 May 2022 and was treated with:\n\n\\- Daily <span style=\"background-color: var(--supplement_highlight);\">potassium</span> Permanganate baths (15mins)\n\n\\- Betamethasone  + moisturising cream\n\n\\- Immune suppressant (<span style=\"background-color: var(--medication_highlight);\">cyclosporine</span>)\n\n\\- Antiobiotics (<span style=\"background-color: var(--medication_highlight);\">dicloxacillin</span>)\n\n\\- Antihistamine (<span style=\"background-color: var(--medication_highlight);\">hydroxyzine</span>)\n\nResults were a lot slower this time and it took approximately 4-5 days before the leaking sores started healing and closing up. Discharged 7 days later on 13 May 2022 and was advised to continue taking 300mg <span style=\"background-color: var(--medication_highlight);\">cyclosporine</span> daily for the next 6 months + steroid cream/moisturising cream\n\nContinued having individual spots pop up randomly but these went away on their own without any intervention.\n\nAround mid July, spots started spreading and was all over my knuckles (LH) and both elbows. These have been getting worse daily and has spread to my scalp, knees, achihles and inside of hand - See round 3 pics\n\nHad another appointment at the hospital on 5th August 2022 and they advised me to taper off <span style=\"background-color: var(--medication_highlight);\">cyclosporine</span> as it didn't seem effective and have put me on <span style=\"background-color: var(--condition_highlight);\">lyme</span>cyclin 600mg daily instead.\n\nHaven't seen any improvements yet since starting the antibiotics.\n\nHas anyone got any idea what this can be? The doctors suspect it's likely a post vaccine reaction as I haven't experienced anything like this before. I had eczema temporarily as a 2 year old which went away on its own.\n\nThey've taking 6 biopsies, multiple swabs from weeping sores, blood tests, etc but can't link it to anything specific.\n\nSo far they suspect:\n\n\\- PLEVA\n\n\\- Atopic dermatitis\n\n\\- Discoid eczema developed into prurigo nodularis\n\n**Note**: My body itches every and any time I scratch a spot that itches, it will turn into a spot and develop into a liquid filled blister over time."
body = "Hello everyone, this is my 1 year update on taking herbs, and most likely my final\u2026 I will tell my story and details on how I got to where I am today. \n\nSo I am 17 years old, when I was diagnosed with <span style=\"background-color: var(--condition_highlight);\">lyme</span> in September of 2019 I was 15. For two months I had no clue what was wrong with me, nor did any doctor. I was told I had a concussion, had endless amount of blood tests, then finally it was suggested that I was tested for <span style=\"background-color: var(--condition_highlight);\">lyme</span>, and sure enough it came back positive. Immediately my doctor gave me doxycycline, but only 10 days, which I am grateful that he did, but 10 days was not enough. I went to an infectious disease specialist, and was not given any further medication and little advice, except to see a psychologist. My symptoms did not improve, I had to quit sports, I was scared to leave home, and my life went downhill. I developed horrible dp/dr, anxiety, muscle aches, fatigue, and loss of appetite. \n(Winter 2019/20) I went through the winter feeling hopeless and thought I was going to die, I couldn\u2019t see a future for myself. I went back to the doctor in the spring, he sent me to do cognitive behaviour therapy, which did help with the mental aspects but the physical issues and dp/dr continued.\n(Summer 2020) With the warm weather through the summer I started to improve slightly, and was meditating consistently to keep my mind clear. I was able to somewhat enjoy the things I use to, but I was still nowhere near normal and when fall came I started going back down hill. I was sick of feeling horrible and hopeless, so I gave up on regular doctors and took my health into my own hands.\n(Fall-winter 2020) I did crazy amounts of research on herbal medicine for <span style=\"background-color: var(--condition_highlight);\">lyme</span> and decided to see a naturopath (to some degree) she practiced some strange ways of healing, but was extremely smart, she recommended a few herbs and supplements, which I took alongside the ones I researched and things started to change.\n(Winter-now 2021) by the end of winter my physical symptoms were almost gone, and by spring-summer my dp/dr finally started to lift too. So here I am today\u2026 my pain is gone, my dp/dr is mostly gone and I feel \u201clow\u201d maybe 2 days every month or two. I have returned to sports, along with all my other regular activities. I have my life back. I beg you to try what I did, everything listed below\u2026\n\nMy solution\u2026\nTake the following daily \n\u2022200mg co enzyme Q 10\n\u20222000 IUD vitamin D\n\u2022500mg black cumin seed oil\n\u2022250mg magnesium \n\u2022Activated charcoal (when herxing, at least 2 hours before or after any herbs)\nThe herbs \n\u2022Uncarine Max Cats Claw (recommended dose on bottle)\n\u2022Otoba bark extract (recommended dose on bottle)\n\u2022oil of oregano (recommended dose on bottle) \n\u2022 Boxwood extract (recommended dose on bottle)\n\nYou can find the uncarine max and otoba at myherbs.net, the rest at any drugstore that sells natural medicine. \nPLEASE TRY THIS, I went from being so weak that I dreaded walking up the stairs at school, to playing a full soccer game like it\u2019s nothing. I love you all, please ask any questions."
